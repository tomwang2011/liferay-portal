Liferay-Releng-App-Description: Apio Architect is a server-side library that facilitates the creation of Apio REST APIs. It's also opinionated to reduce the amount of code API developers have to write. This is also achieved by out-of-the-box implementations of well known patterns in REST APIs, such as the Collection Pattern.
